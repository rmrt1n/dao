# ClubDAO - Decentralizing Clubs and Club Union Operation

---

## Purpose of ClubDAO ‚ö°

Make it easy for any university clubs to create DAOs and collaborate with other clubs.

# Why DAO‚ùì

With a DAO structure, we don‚Äôt need a president or committee set specifically for the Club Union. Club members can coordinate with the DAO to create events, tasks and apply for treasury funding through votes and proposals.

# Functions üéØ

## Individual Club DAO(s)

A DAO management tool for clubs

1. Create DAO and register club members.
2. Create proposals related to Club activities and operations.

## DAOs of DAOs

A DAO comprising of multiple Club DAOs, allowing DAOs to coordinate with each other. 

1. Facilitates the creation of SubDAO(s) that automatically expire after a set period, providing clubs with an opportunity to collaborate and coordinate.
2. Allows creation of tasks as bounties to allow Clubs to leverage resources from other Clubs.

# DAO Membership ‚ô†Ô∏è

Clubs will have the option to assign membership either through distributing ERC-20 Tokens or NFT during the creation of the DAO. Holders of these token will have the privilege to vote, create proposal and participate in the DAO‚Äôs Discourse. 

The *******DAOs of DAOs*******  will likely have its own ERC-20 token to allow DAOs to vote on matters related between two or more DAOs. 

# DAO Treasury ü™ô

There will be two categories for treasury:

1) Club DAO‚Äôs Treasury: Related to the internal Club DAO‚Äôs activity, funded through membership fee or other source of income for the club.

2) DAOs of DAOs‚Äô Treasury: A shared treasury between all the Club DAOs which will be funded by the existing Club DAOs and SubDAOs.
